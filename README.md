* Add AI

* More tracks
	could add more variety

* GP Season with points
* Add various difficulties

* Rename Purple Sector to Time Sector

* have AI slow down in grass & sand same, and they should display particle Physics

*	maybe reduce grass drag a little to keep AI in race
* Grass slows down car more
* slip streams

* could be even more subtle
* brakes are more subtle, not handbrake

* Timer for full race
	needs checking - take account of lap not just track position
* Correct Race Position

* Drop suspension
* Particle Physics


* GP Season with points
* player chooses how many races, and how many laps for each race
	this should be 1 to 12 (the current limit in the text box)
* for each each create a random hex string between 1 & 16 characters as a seed
* Award Points for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place - show results of last race, and sub total points for season to date.
* At end of season show results of placement in season 

* Still have option to add own seed for race

* Update sound so revs aligns with gears


* Choose Team to Race for, stats based on 2025 season
*Choose Tyres - soft, medium, hard, intermediate, wet
* Change tyre type in pits
* In F1 Season have random wet races & races where weather changes


* Countdown to start should be like F1 race - lights come on sequentially, then go out for start
* Adjust the screeching tyre sound, shouldn't be able to hear it on grass, and gravel
* Is the mini top speed too high, compared with the F1 car?

*Escape - always enters pause screen when in race
*Able to Choose to change tyre type in pits

*If chose a dry single race, it should stay dry, add random option for chance of change.
*If starts wet, start on wet tyres

*Correct Race Position - needs checking - take account of lap not just track position

* Adjust breaks, like steering, tapping is gradual, holding down more powerful  

* Pits - check logic, orientation, and position. Make entry easier, with assisted braking
* Tighter grid at start, like actual F1 race - create a revs dial, if in green set off on lights out, too high wheel spin, too low, slower getaway
* Fix title <title>F1 Circuit Gen</title>

* Limit race to 12 cars


* Correct Race Position - needs checking - take account of lap not just track position
* Pits - check logic, orientation, and position - it should be a long stretch at the side of the racecourse
* Ensure AI cars reset when they flip
* Player car changes colour depending on team choice - ensure other cars are in correct colours for teams
* Ability to be able to accelerate out of slide, when back end swings out

What other cars could we add?
